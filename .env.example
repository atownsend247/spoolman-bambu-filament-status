# BambuLab Printer Configuration
# Each printer requires 3 config items
# These 3 are all required as this is what initialised the 
# connection to the printer via MQTT and should be kept private!
# For each printer they need prefixing with SPOOLMAN_BAMBU_PRINTER_X
# Where X is the identifier for the printer e.g 1, 2, 3
# For more information and where to find these parameters
#Â please see associated section on the readme.
